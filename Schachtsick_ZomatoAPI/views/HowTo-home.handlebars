	  <h1> Welcome to the How-to for Zomato API </h1>
	  <p> By Jeffrey Schachtsick</p>
	  <h3>A quick How-to of this guide</h3>
	  <p>A little background on Zomato, it is a service which allows people to find the best 
	  food and drink in a place you are going or where you are now when you want it.  Are 
	  you looking for a perfect pint of beer in Melbourne Australia?  Are you looking for 
	  sushi in Rome?  Looking for something you have not experienced in your local area?  
	  Zomato may be able to assist you with those questions.</p>

	  <p>The Zomato API is a way to access data about the cities and the restaurants in 
	  those cities.  Some data that one can access are cuisines available in a city, average 
	  cost for two people in a particular restaurant, and a restaurants ratings.  The data 
	  that is requested is done through a query and returns JSON objects as a response.  
	  The goal of this guide is to mention the different types of queries available through 
	  the API and provide some examples.</p>
	  <p>In this guide we will discuss some setup with Zomato and the following types of queries:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>
			<code>/q</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/cuisines</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/establishments</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/geocode</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/restaurant</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/search</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>/collections</code>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>There will be a couple queries in which I will leave out of the document, because 
	  <code>/location</code>, <code>/location_details</code>, <code>/cities</code>, 
	  <code>/cuisines</code>, and <code>/restaurant</code> will overlap in coverage of JSON 
	  object material returned.  Data such as reviews and photos can not be accessed unless 
	  with a Partner level API key access, so the <code>/reveiws</code> query will also not 
	  be covered.
